					<h4>The Rise of Suburban America</h4>
					<p>
                        After 1945, mass migration to suburban areas transformed American life, with suburban
                        populations soaring from 13% pre-World War II to over half by 2010. Suburbia redefined the
                        nation’s economy, politics, and social life, encouraging car dependency, commuting, and new
                        spending habits while affecting issues like race, taxes, energy, and community dynamics. The
                        single-family home with a yard became emblematic of the American Dream, and suburbs were not
                        only residential but also critical economic hubs for high-tech, retail, and office employment.
                        Politically, suburbia shaped American majorities and nurtured diverse movements, from grassroots
                        conservatism to environmentalism and social justice. Two stages marked suburban growth: postwar
                        suburbanization (1945-1970) driven by racialized, government-backed segregation and a later
                        shift toward diversity post-1970, as suburbs diversified with immigrants, African Americans, and
                        varied socioeconomic groups. Yet, disparities persisted, especially in affluent, exclusionary
                        suburbs, prompting regional reform for sustainable, equitable development. Recently, suburbia
                        faced both crisis and renewal, reflecting its ongoing complexity in American society.
					</p>
					<p>
                        This interested me because the creation of suburban communities like Levittown represents a
                        massive cultural and lifestyle shift in post-WWII America, offering insight into how society
                        changed after the war. The way these communities shaped family life, economic status, and even
                        racial divides is fascinating because it shows how design and policy choices can impact people's
                        lives and still influence American culture today.

					<h4>The Civil Rights Movement</h4>
					<p>
                        The Civil Rights Movement was a transformative struggle for social justice that took place
                        mainly during the 1950s and 1960s, aimed at securing equal rights for Black Americans under U.S.
                        law. Although the Civil War abolished slavery, it did not end the systemic racism and
                        discrimination that Black communities continued to face, especially in the South. Led by figures
                        like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Malcolm X, and organizations such as the NAACP,
                        SNCC, and CORE, activists used protests, boycotts, and acts of civil disobedience to challenge
                        segregation and injustice. Key events like the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the March on Washington,
                        and the Selma marches drew national attention to their cause, resulting in landmark legislation
                        like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which helped dismantle
                        legalized segregation and protect voting rights. Despite fierce resistance, the movement
                        reshaped America’s legal landscape and inspired future social justice efforts, as racial
                        equality remains an ongoing struggle to this day.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        This interested me because of the bravery and determination of leaders like Rosa Parks and Martin
                        Luther King Jr. inspire me, and learning about the ways ordinary people united to challenge
                        injustice is both powerful and motivating. The Civil Rights Movement shows how social change can
                        happen through grassroots organization, which makes me appreciate the freedoms I have today and
                        the sacrifices that were made for them.

					<h4>Cold War Tensions and McCarthyism</h4>
					<p>
                        Following World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union became locked in the Cold War, a
                        tense period of political and ideological rivalry that fueled widespread fear of communism
                        within the U.S. Amid concerns over Soviet espionage, figures like FBI director J. Edgar Hoover
                        equated protests, including civil rights movements led by Martin Luther King Jr., with communist
                        subversion. Hoover labeled King a communist and undertook covert operations to intimidate him.
                        These fears were rooted in real Soviet espionage activities within America, often aided by U.S.
                        citizens. Responding to growing fears, President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9835,
                        which required federal employees to undergo loyalty screenings, signaling a new era of
                        anticommunist sentiment known as the Red Scare. During this time, congressional bodies like the
                        House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) intensified efforts to uncover alleged communists
                        within the federal government and the entertainment industry. Hollywood studios, under pressure,
                        established blacklists that barred suspected communists from employment, impacting careers and
                        lives. U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy became notorious for using hearsay and intimidation to
                        accuse celebrities, intellectuals, and political opponents of disloyalty, a crusade that lasted
                        until his methods were publicly denounced in 1954. The FBI, under Hoover, played a pivotal role
                        in compiling information on suspected communists through surveillance, which led to high-profile
                        cases, including the convictions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage. This era left a
                        profound impact on American society, marking a period of intense scrutiny and suppression of
                        political dissent.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        This interested me because this period highlighted how fear and paranoia can drive political
                        decisions in ways that seem extreme or unfair in hindsight. The idea of accusing people of
                        disloyalty without evidence is shocking, yet it made me think about how fear of the “other” can
                        sometimes override rationality and lead to harmful consequences, a concept that still feels
                        relevant today.

					<h4>The Space Race and Technological Innovation</h4>
					<p>
                        By the mid-1950s, the Cold War had deeply permeated daily life in the United States and the
                        Soviet Union, driven by an escalating arms race, nuclear threat, and ongoing espionage. This
                        geopolitical tension was reflected in various global conflicts, notably the Korean War, as well
                        as ideological battles played out in the media. The launch of Sputnik by the Soviets in 1957
                        marked a pivotal moment, awakening fears among Americans about losing their competitive edge in
                        space exploration and the potential for Soviet military capabilities to reach U.S. soil. In
                        response, President Eisenhower established NASA in 1958 to spearhead U.S. space initiatives. The
                        ensuing Space Race not only focused on technological achievements but also carried immense
                        symbolic weight as a demonstration of ideological superiority. President John F. Kennedy’s bold
                        declaration to land a man on the moon by the decade's end galvanized national efforts,
                        culminating in the historic Apollo 11 mission of 1969, where Neil Armstrong became the first
                        human to set foot on the lunar surface, representing a significant victory for the United States
                        in the contest against the Soviet Union.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        This interested me because it showed just how far scientific ambition and international rivalry
                        could push human potential. The fact that a national goal like the Apollo moon landing inspired
                        so much innovation makes me think about how far society can go when it focuses on a shared
                        purpose, especially in science and technology.
