					<h4>19th Amendment</h4>
					<p>
                        A strategy of passing suffrage acts in each state, nine western states adopted woman suffrage
                        legislation by 1912. By 1916, almost all the major suffrage organizations were united behind
                        the goal of a constitutional amendment. When New York adopted woman suffrage in 1917 and
                        President Wilson changed his position to support an amendment in 1918, the political balance
                        began to shift. During WWI, many women took up larger roles in society since their husbands
                        were away fighting. They argued they deserve the right in society to vote since they were the
                        ones making decisions while the U.S. was in the war.
                    </p>
                    <p>I’m interested in this because growing up in a world where woman had rights and then realizing
                        that they got that right not thousands of years ago and was pretty recent.</p>

					<h4>The Herrin Massacre</h4>
					<p>
                        The Herrin Massacre of June 1922 was a devastating incident born out of a coal miners' strike in
                        Herrin, Illinois. Non-union workers, who were primarily Black and recruited from out of state
                        without being informed they were being used as strikebreakers, were met by angry union miners
                        who ambushed them on their way to the mine. A deadly shootout ensued, resulting in the deaths of
                        both strikebreakers and miners. The non-union workers eventually surrendered under a promise of
                        safe passage, but the violence only escalated. As they were marched from the mine, the crowd
                        turned on them, killing the mine superintendent and brutally gunning down workers as they tried
                        to escape. In total, 21 men were killed, with some hunted down in the woods or shot at a local
                        cemetery.
                        National disgust followed, but local juries, sympathetic to the miners, acquitted those charged,
                        and over 200 indictments were dropped. Union president John L. Lewis sent miners back to work
                        under the old contract, but the damage was done. The UMW's reputation was shattered, and its
                        power continued to decline throughout the 1920s, marking the massacre as a pivotal and grim
                        moment in labor history.
                    </p>
					<p>
                        This interested me because the strikebreakers had nothing to do with this, and they were all
                        killed and then the miners were acquitted. It’s crazy how they could shoot down people in cold
                        blood and get away with it.

					<h4>Battle of the Somme</h4>
					<p>
                        A costly and attrition campaign that initially aimed for a rapid breakthrough to Bapaume and
                        Cambrai, but setbacks forced British commander Sir Douglas Haig to adopt a method of limited
                        advances to wear down German forces. Rejecting French commander Joffre's plan for a frontal
                        assault on the Thiepval defenses, Haig concentrated attacks on the southern flank, capturing key
                        positions but missing opportunities for further gains. The battle is notable for the first use
                        of tanks on September 15, though their premature deployment led to limited success due to
                        tactical mishandling and technical defects. By the time the offensive ended in November, both
                        sides had suffered heavy casualties—over 600,000 for the Allies and more than 440,000 for the
                        Germans—without a decisive outcome, but the tanks hinted at future warfare innovations.

					</p>
                    <p>
                        I was interested in this because it’s the first-time tanks are introduced into warfare. Even
                        though it didn’t work out looking on it today what would have happened if they gave up on them,
                        since they are still used today.

					<h4>Mary Church Terrell</h4>
					<p>
                        Mary Eliza Church Terrell (1863–1954) was a pioneering American social activist, educator, and
                        early advocate for civil rights and women's suffrage. Born to formerly enslaved parents who
                        became successful business owners in Memphis, Tennessee, she enjoyed educational opportunities
                        rare for African Americans at the time, earning a bachelor’s and master’s degree from Oberlin
                        College. Terrell co-founded and served as the first president of the National Association of
                        Colored Women, working to end racial discrimination and promote educational reform. She was also
                        the first Black woman appointed to the District of Columbia Board of Education and a founding
                        member of the NAACP. In 1949, she successfully fought against the exclusion of Black women from
                        the American Association of University Women, further advancing civil rights.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        This interested me because her parents were slaves and became successful, and she was the first
                        African American woman to earn a degree.
