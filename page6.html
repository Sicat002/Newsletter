					<h4>Themes and traits</h4>
					<p>
						The theme of social justice and equality shows up in several events and people. Ida B. Wells and
						Mary Eliza Church Terrell worked hard to fight against racism and sexism. The 19th Amendment was
						a big win for women’s right to vote and gender equality. The Civil Rights Movement was an
						important time in the fight for racial justice, showing how powerful people can be when they
						work together. On the other hand, Japanese American internment during World War II was a clear
						example of civil rights being violated, reminding us to always protect people’s freedoms.
					</p>
					<p>
						The theme of war and conflict shows up in many important events. The Battle of Little Big Horn
						and the Civil War were key moments in American history. The Battle of Somme showed the heavy
						losses of World War I. The Pearl Harbor attack pulled the U.S. into World War II. Cold War
						tensions and McCarthyism revealed the fears and clashes of ideas in the 20th century. 9/11 and
						the War on Terror show how modern conflicts shape the world today. These events remind us how
						wars can change nations and people, bringing big political, social, and cultural changes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Advocacy for social change is a common trait. Ida B. Wells and Mary Eliza Church Terrell fought
						for civil rights and racial equality. The 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote,
						connects to their work for gender equality. The Civil Rights Movement carried on their fight for
						justice. This shows a strong trait of standing up for justice, equality, and making society
						better.
					</p>
					<p>
						War and its consequences is an important trait. The Battle of Little Big Horn, the Civil War,
						and the Battle of Somme were major conflicts that showed the human and political costs of war.
						The Pearl Harbor attack and 9/11 brought the U.S. into big global conflicts. Cold War tensions
						and McCarthyism showed how ideas can lead to conflict without fighting. This theme highlights
						how war affects both the battlefield and societies as a whole.
					</p>
					<p>
						Transformative economic and social shifts is another common trait. The Great Depression and the
						Dust Bowl
						showed the struggles of the 1930s with economic and environmental challenges. The rise of
						suburban America reflected the prosperity and changes after World War II. Social media and the
						internet show how technology creates new ways of living and working. This theme focuses on how
						events change economies, societies, and everyday life.

					<h4>Related Events</h4>
					<p>
						The Civil War, Ida B. Wells, and The Civil Rights Movement are deeply intertwined as milestones
						in the ongoing struggle for equality in the United States. The Civil War (1861–1865) was a
						pivotal moment, fought primarily over the issue of slavery, and its aftermath led to the 13th,
						14th, and 15th Amendments, which aimed to secure freedom and rights for African Americans
						(History.com, 2020). However, even with the formal abolition of slavery, Black Americans
						continued to face systemic racism and violence, a reality that figures like Ida B. Wells
						tirelessly fought against. As an investigative journalist and activist, Wells brought attention
						to the lynching of Black Americans, working to expose and dismantle the structures of white
						supremacy that persisted after Reconstruction (Britannica.com, 2020). This fight for equality laid
						the groundwork for the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s, which sought to end
						segregation, secure voting rights, and challenge discriminatory laws (History.com, 2020).
						Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and organizations like the NAACP built upon the foundations
						laid by activists like Wells, pushing for a more inclusive interpretation of the promises made
						during the Civil War. The movement culminated in landmark achievements such as the Civil Rights
						Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but it also highlighted the ongoing struggle for
						full racial justice, a theme that continued well beyond these legislative victories.

					<h4>Events I would teach</h4>
					<p>The Civil War (1861–1865)</p>
					<p>
						The Civil War is foundational to understanding the United States' evolution. It was a turning
						point in the nation's history, deeply influencing its social, political, and economic
						structures. The war not only ended slavery but also set the stage for future civil rights
						struggles, making it essential for understanding systemic racism, the development of federal
						power, and the ongoing quest for equality. Studying the Civil War provides students with
						critical insights into how conflict can reshape a nation’s identity and how historical struggles
						for freedom continue to influence present-day discussions about race and justice.
					</p>
					<p>The Civil Rights Movement (1950s–1960s)</p>
					<p>
						The Civil Rights Movement is pivotal in shaping modern American society. The efforts of
						activists like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Ida B. Wells (whose work contributed to
						the movement’s foundation) created significant social and legal changes, such as the Civil
						Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This movement highlights the power of
						nonviolent protest, grassroots organizing, and the fight against systemic oppression. It remains
						relevant in the ongoing struggle for racial justice and equality, making it crucial for students
						to understand its historical context and continuing legacy.
					</p>
					<p>9/11 and the War on Terror (2001–present)</p>
					<p>
						The September 11, 2001 attacks and the subsequent War on Terror changed the course of American
						and global history in profound ways. The attacks led to significant shifts in U.S. foreign and
						domestic policy, including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the creation of the Department of
						Homeland Security, and the erosion of civil liberties in the name of national security. This
						event has shaped the way Americans view security, privacy, and their role in global politics.
						Understanding 9/11 is essential not only for grasping modern geopolitical conflicts but also for
						reflecting on how traumatic events can change national identities and global relations.
