					<h4>Watergate and Trust in Government</h4>
					<p>
                        The Watergate scandal, a series of interconnected political scandals during President Richard M.
                        Nixon's administration, began with the arrest of five burglars at the Democratic National
                        Committee (DNC) headquarters in the Watergate complex on June 17, 1972. Among the burglars were
                        individuals with ties to the CIA and the Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP). Initial
                        media coverage, influenced by the White House's public relations efforts, downplayed the
                        administration's involvement. However, investigative journalists Bob Woodward and Carl
                        Bernstein, aided by leaks from an anonymous source later identified as FBI deputy director W.
                        Mark Felt, uncovered significant connections between Nixon's aides and the break-in, revealing a
                        broader campaign of political espionage tied to Nixon's re-election efforts. The scandal
                        culminated in Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, making him the first U.S. president to step
                        down in response to a political crisis, profoundly affecting politics and journalism in the
                        United States.
					</p>
					<p>
                        This interested me because Watergate marked a huge turning point in the relationship between
                        American citizens and their government, showing how damaging corruption can be to public trust.
                        It’s interesting because it taught me that transparency and accountability are vital to a
                        functioning democracy, and it’s a reminder that leaders must be held to high ethical standards.

					<h4>The Rise of the Internet</h4>
					<p>
                        The Internet is a revolutionary system architecture that connects various computer networks
                        globally, fundamentally transforming mass communication, media, and commerce. Often described as
                        a "network of networks," it originated in the United States during the 1970s but became publicly
                        accessible in the early 1990s, with around 4.5 billion people estimated to have access by 2020.
                        This rapid growth is fueled by the rise of smart technology and the Internet of Things (IoT),
                        which links various devices, from smartphones to security cameras. The Internet facilitates
                        diverse human interactions through social media, email, and collaborative tools while serving as
                        a platform for numerous e-businesses that conduct transactions online. Early networks like SABRE
                        and AUTODIN I laid the groundwork for shared computer resources, leading to the development of
                        ARPANET, the first host-to-host network, established by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1969.
                        ARPANET utilized packet switching technology to efficiently transmit data in smaller packets,
                        allowing for more flexible and cost-effective communication compared to traditional methods.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        This interested me because the rapid spread of the internet reshaped every aspect of life from
                        communication to shopping to education. It fascinates me because it shows how quickly technology
                        can connect people worldwide and create new opportunities. At the same time, it raises questions
                        about privacy, screen time, and how technology shapes our lives, both positively and negatively.

					<h4>9/11 and the War on Terror</h4>
					<p>
                        The "war on terrorism" is the American-led global counterterrorism campaign launched in response
                        to the September 11, 2001, attacks, marked by its vast scope and significant impact on
                        international relations, likened to the Cold War. It encompassed military actions in Afghanistan
                        and Iraq, covert operations in countries like Yemen, and substantial increases in military
                        spending. The intelligence aspect involved reorganizing agencies, boosting funding for
                        intelligence operations, and capturing suspected terrorists, many of whom were detained at
                        Guantánamo Bay. Diplomatically, the U.S. sought to build a coalition of allies and counter
                        anti-American sentiment, while domestically, it enacted new anti-terrorism legislation and
                        established the Department of Homeland Security. Initial successes included the arrests of
                        hundreds of terrorist suspects and the prevention of major attacks on U.S. soil. However,
                        critics argued that the failures outweighed these successes, claiming that military actions
                        scattered al-Qaeda, fueled anti-Americanism among Muslims, and led to a perception that the war
                        was a facade for U.S. geopolitical ambitions. By 2004, the drawbacks were clear: Iraq was
                        descending into chaos post-Saddam Hussein's removal, with civilian casualties soaring, and a
                        reconstituted Taliban was escalating violence in Afghanistan, complicating U.S. objectives in
                        both countries.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        This interested me because the 9/11 attacks were a pivotal moment that completely changed
                        American foreign policy and domestic security. I find it compelling because it shows how a
                        single event can alter a country’s priorities and lead to widespread changes, from airport
                        security to international relations. It also made me reflect on the impact of such tragedies on
                        individuals and society.

					<h4>Social Media and Cultural Shifts</h4>
					<p>
                        Social media is a form of mass media communication on the Internet that encompasses platforms
                        for social networking and microblogging, where users share information, ideas, personal
                        messages, and content such as videos. While social networking focuses on building communities,
                        social media emphasizes creating an audience. The roots of social media trace back to the early
                        1970s with e-mail and chat programs, but persistent online communities began with the USENET in
                        1979, which allowed message posting within subject-specific newsgroups. The 1993 launch of the
                        Mosaic web browser made these systems more accessible with a graphical interface. Early social
                        networks like Classmates.com and SixDegrees.com utilized web technology, with SixDegrees
                        introducing key features such as user profiles and private messaging, though it ultimately
                        failed to monetize its user base during the dot-com bust. The early 21st century brought the
                        popularity of social media sites like Friendster, MySpace, and Facebook, which boasts billions
                        of users worldwide, alongside platforms like YouTube and TikTok for specific content sharing,
                        and LinkedIn for professional networking. However, concerns about the negative effects of social
                        media have emerged, including increased schadenfreude, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and
                        feelings of inadequacy, potentially stemming from the dehumanizing nature of online
                        interactions.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        This interested me because social media has transformed how people connect and communicate, which
                        is intriguing because it’s both powerful and complex. While social media allows for instant
                        connection and self-expression, it also brings issues like mental health impacts,
                        misinformation, and social pressures. Understanding these effects makes me more aware of the
                        role technology plays in shaping culture and personal identity.
