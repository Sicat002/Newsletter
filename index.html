					<h4>Mark Twain</h4>
					<p> Mark Twain was born on November 30, 1835, in the small town of Florida, MO. His real name was
						Samuel Langhorne Clemens. His essays and novels, including the American classic, The Adventures
						of Huckleberry Finn, are a testament to his intelligence and insight. Twain worked as a
						steamboat captain for years before the Civil War. Mark Twain was a riverboat term that means two
						fathoms, the point at which it is safe for the boat to navigate the waters. Twain got his first
						big break as a writer in 1865 with an article about life in a mining camp, called Jim Smiley and
						His Jumping Frog, also called The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County. It was very
						favorably received and printed in newspapers and magazines all over the country. This led him to
						start becoming a travel writer and he would travel to different countries. Twain was much
						admired during his lifetime. The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor was created in his honor
						and has been given annually since 1998 to “people who have had an impact on American society in
						ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark
						Twain.”.</p>
					<p>
						This interested me because America considers him to be one of the greats. Art imitates life in
						any form. What is happening in the present or even the past could affect art. Being able to have
						insight into his world and how his art came about is what interested me the most.</p>

					<h4>Ida B. Wells</h4>
					<p>
						Ida B. Wells was an African American journalist, abolitionist and feminist who led an
						anti-lynching crusade in the United States in the 1890s. Born an enslaved person in Holly
						Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, Wells was the oldest daughter. The Confederate states
						were decreed free by the Union thanks to the Emancipation Proclamation about six months after
						Ida's birth. At the age of 16, her parents died of a yellow fever outbreak. she convinced a
						nearby country school administrator that she was 18 and landed a job as a teacher. May 1884, she
						bought a first-class train ticket, and the crew told her to move to a car for African Americans.
						When she sued the train station and won, they overturned the ruling and that is what led her to
						becoming an activist. Mostly known for her lynching campaign which started because Three African
						American men Tom Moss, Calvin McDowell and Will Stewart set up a grocery store. They defended
						their store from white men and killed some of them. They were arrested and later taken from
						their cells and lynched before they could even defend themselves. This incident led her to write
						about more lynchings happening all over the country.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was interested in this because in a world where men were supposed to be on “top,” she fought
						through it all and made a name for herself. Not only was she a woman but, an African American
						woman so that made it even harder for her. She created her own business and did not let anyone
						silence her.

					<h4>The Battle of Little Big Horn</h4>
					<p>
						In 1875, after gold was discovered in South Dakota’s Black Hills, the U.S. Army ignored previous
						treaty agreements and invaded the region. By the late spring of 1876, more than 10,000 Native
						Americans had gathered in a camp along the Little Bighorn River. They were warned to return to
						their camps, or they would be attacked. The leaders of this camp were Sitting Bull and Crazy
						Horse. George Custer’s 7th Cavalry attacked on June 25. Custer had 600 men and were met with
						3,000 native American warriors. Custer and all his men died that day. The result of this was the
						United States government now saw the Native Americans as a threat and confined them to their
						camps.
					</p>
					<p>I was interested in this because the Native Americans won the battle. I do not think they took
						them seriously as a threat and it showed. I think two men bringing together others is inspiring.
						It shows with the right cause people can come together.</p>

					<h4>Civil War</h4>
					<p>
						Abraham Lincoln, candidate of the explicitly antislavery Republican Party, won the 1860
						presidential election. During this time, 11 Southern states seceded from the Union to protect
						what they saw as their right to keep slaves. These states were organized as the Confederate
						States of America. Jefferson Davis was the Confederate president. Disregarding Lincoln’s vow,
						Confederate forces opened fire on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. This marked the beginning of
						the American Civil War. In September 1862 Lincoln called on the seceded states to return to the
						Union or have their slaves declared free. he issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1,
						1863. It had the practical effect of permitting recruitment of African Americans for the Union
						army and declared all slaves in the confederate states free. The South was devastated by the
						war, but the Union was preserved, and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in
						1865, officially abolished slavery in the entire country.
					</p>
					<p>This war interested me because it was between our own country. American Civil War remains the
						deadliest war in U.S. history. It’s crazy how the war between our own people was the deadliest
						we have ever had. It also is the war that ended slavery in America. </p>
