					<h4>The Great Depression (1929-1939)</h4>
					<p>
						The Great Depression began with the stock market crash of October 1929, also known as "Black
						Tuesday." Millions of Americans lost their jobs as businesses closed and banks failed.
						Unemployment reached nearly 25%, and many families struggled to find food and shelter. President
						Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, a series of programs aimed at providing
						relief, recovery, and reform. These programs included Social Security, public works projects,
						and financial regulations. Despite the efforts, the U.S. economy didn't fully recover until the
						onset of World War II, which created jobs through military production.
					</p>
					<p>
						This interested me because I lived through the recession that took place 2007-2009 (The Great
						Recession). it wasn't as severe as the Great Depression; it was the most serious financial
						crisis since then. The recession was triggered by the collapse of the housing market, risky
						lending practices, and the failure of major financial institutions. Fortunately, I did not lose
						my house, but I did see others lose theirs.

					<h4>The Dust Bowl (1930s)</h4>
					<p>
						During the 1930s, severe droughts and poor farming practices led to massive dust storms across
						the Great Plains, known as the Dust Bowl. The storms destroyed crops and livestock, leaving
						thousands of farmers without a livelihood. Many families, known as "Okies," migrated west to
						California in search of work and better living conditions. The environmental disaster deepened
						the effects of the Great Depression in rural America. Federal programs like the Soil
						Conservation Service were created to help farmers recover and prevent future disasters. The Dust
						Bowl remains one of the worst environmental crises in U.S. history.
					</p>
					<p>This interested me because It shows how intertwined environmental and economic factors can
						compound hardships during already difficult times. This was going on while the great depression
						was happening, and this gives more insight into how bad it really was.

					<h4>Pearl Harbor Attack</h4>
					<p>
						On December 7, 1941, the Japanese military launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, a U.S.
						naval base in Hawaii. The attack destroyed or damaged eight battleships, several other vessels,
						and over 300 aircraft. More than 2,400 Americans were killed, with many more injured. The
						following day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared war on Japan, bringing the United States
						into World War II. The attack united Americans, who were previously divided about entering the
						war, and led to massive military mobilization. Pearl Harbor is remembered as a pivotal moment in
						U.S. history.
					</p>
					<p>This interests me because Pearl Harbor was the first large-scale foreign attack on an American
						territory. I find myself comparing it to 9/11, which was the first time America was attacked on
						its mainland. It's crazy to think that, in all those years, the U.S. had never faced an attack
						on its homeland by a foreign force before 9/11, and the only previous major attempt was Pearl
						Harbor.

					<h4>Japanese American Internment</h4>
					<p>
						Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which
						authorized the forced relocation of Japanese Americans to internment camps. Over 120,000 people,
						the majority of whom were U.S. citizens, were sent to live in isolated camps for the duration of
						World War II. Families were forced to leave their homes, businesses, and belongings behind,
						often with little notice. The government justified the action as a security measure, though no
						evidence of espionage was found among those interned. Conditions in the camps were harsh, with
						overcrowding, poor sanitation, and a lack of privacy. In 1988, the U.S. government formally
						apologized and paid reparations to survivors.
					</p>
					<p>
						This interests me because it highlights our fears and mistakes. We knew it was wrong, yet we
						still did this to people. A few bad individuals don't represent the entire group. I don’t think
						it was the right decision, but it can serve as an important teaching moment for many Americans.
						We've seen similar racism resurface when COVID-19 hit the world.
